## About
biotopium is a distributed, platform-independent multiplayer game running on a custom blockchain.

## Implementation
The core of biotopium is implemented in Kotlin.
Leveraging the Kotlin Multiplatform feature as well as interoperability with Java and JavaScript, 
the project currently targets the platforms JS (Browser) and JVM.

## Development
Currently, this is rather a Proof-of-Concept for decentralized game implementations than a production-ready game.
We use a highly incremental approach for the development cycle.

Since this is a prototype and in favor of rapid development many breaking changes will occur in the early phase of development.

## Build Requirements
Besides JDK 11 and the Kotlin compiler the following tools are required to build this project:
- GCC
- Go 16
