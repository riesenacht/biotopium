# About
biotopium is a decentralized, platform-independent multiplayer game running on a custom blockchain.

# Implementation
The core of the decentralized game is implemented in Kotlin.
Kotlin is a multi-purpose and multi-paradigmal programming language developed by JetBrains.
Kotlin brings the benefit of complete platform independence.

While the JVM acts as the default target, Kotlin can also be compiled to JavaScript or to a native binary.
Leveraging the Kotlin Multiplatform feature as well as interoperability with Java and JavaScript, the project currently targets the platforms Browser and JVM.

# Development
Currently, this is rather a Proof-of-Concept for decentralized game implementations than a production-ready game.
We use a highly incremental approach for the development cycle.

Since this is a prototype and in favor of rapid development many breaking changes will occur in the early phase of development.
